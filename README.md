*****C++:(string amalgrum.cpp)******

 have uses the concept that two different number having same no of digits there SUM 
and PRODUCT both cannot be same(one of them can be same but not both)...

In this question i have converted each word into a number and store its sum ,product and 
no of digits in structure array.

so in two strings ,for each word i have done above mention process.
 after then sort the structure array of words for both strings according to sum.
 and after that campare sum,product,and no of character if these three are equal than only 
 two words can be anagram.
 
*****python:(check_anagrams.py)******

read words in list sort each word of both strings ,store words in dictionary for both
then for each word of one string campare with word of another string from words store in dictionary::


 *******see my approach in code ..if there is any ambiguity please do inform me*********.
